The dataset is made available directly on the Airbnb website . The data used in this analysis are those as of October 13, 2020. Prior to the analysis, I carried out appropriate data cleansing and preparation.


## Objective <a name="objective"></a>

The purpose of this analysis is to explore a dataset of Airbnb in Berlin with particular regard to the differences between the former East and West: 
1. _What are the key factors that influence the price?_
2. _Where are the most expensive neighbourhoods?_
3. _Where are the most popular neighbourhoods?_
